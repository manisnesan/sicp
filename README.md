We are reading SICP in September, feel free to join us.

The standard reading of SICP is 26 lectures, our schedule is in a Google
Calendar.  We collaborate using IRC and our Google Group.

For everything you need (PDF ebook, code and projects), simply clone

There is a full-blown [MIT OpenCourseWare class for
SICP](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
directly linked below).  It has a study group/forum, lecture notes and
